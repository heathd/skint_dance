    <h1>Day tickets at Skint 2014</h1>
  </div>

  <h3>Day tickets will go on sale in September</h3>
  <p>Once all full weekend tickets are sold, day tickets will then go on sale. They will also be available on the door.</p>

  <h3>Ticket prices</h3>
  <ul>
    <% TicketType.day.each do |ticket_type| %>
      <li><%= ticket_type.description %> - <%= ticket_type.formatted_price %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>

  <h3>Important notes</h3>
  <p>Day tickets do not include any meals, food or accommodation.</p>
  <p>The kitchen will be extremely busy and there <b>will not be space</b> in the hall/kitchen for you to prepare food, wash up, etc. However, you're welcome to bring pre-prepared food or a picnic and to eat in the hall with everyone else (there should be space to sit at the tables).</p>
  <p>Alternatively there are <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/RKUyO">several lovely pubs</a> a few minutes walk away. </p>
  <p>You can use the campsite/camping car area which costs Â£5 per unit per night. Payment for this is directly to the campsite owner. The campsite is adjacent to Ashover Village Hall (2 minutes walk).</p>
