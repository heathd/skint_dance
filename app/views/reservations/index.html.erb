    <p><strong>Participating in Skint</strong></p>
    <p>Skint depends on the cooperation everyone attending to help out with day-to-day tasks.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Booking people in at the welcome desk on Friday evening</li>

      <li>Moving furniture between dancing sessions and meals</li>
      <li>Scrubbing and chopping veg and fruit</li>
      <li>Preparing plates etc. and serving up for meals</li>
      <li>Washing up and tidying the kitchen</li>
      <li>Sweeping and cleaning at the end on Sun and Mon</li>
    </ul>
